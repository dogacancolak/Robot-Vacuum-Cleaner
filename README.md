# Robot Vacuum Cleaner Simulation
### Which algorithm performs better in vacuum cleaning a house?

This is a simulation where different [coverage path planning algorithms](https://www.cnet.com/news/how-to-choose-the-best-robot-vacuum-for-your-home-roomba-neato-ecovacs-2019/) can be tested in customized indoor environments.

This simulation features the following algorithms:
* Random walk
* Snaking
* Spiraling
* Wall following
* Finally, a hybrid algorithm comprised of the four above.

### Why this project?
It all started with mom buying a Roomba, which led me to observe its behavior and inspired me to explore this rather trivial technology in our daily lives.
